# Print Maps

Web maps normally don't print well, as their resolution is much lower than
normal print resolution, not to mention the various other unwanted text and
elements that print along with the map. Print Maps changes that by leveraging
[Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) to render print
resolution maps in the browser.
